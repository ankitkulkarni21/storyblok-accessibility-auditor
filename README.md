Storyblok Accessibility Auditor: A Full-Stack Tool 

The Storyblok Accessibility Auditor is a full-stack developer solution engineered to validate content within any Storyblok space against common structural accessibility and quality standards. Built for speed and scalability in a hackathon environment, it transforms content governance from a manual check into an automated process.

Our Winning Features:
 We focused on building a powerful, extensible tool that provides immediate value to developers and content editors.

1. Dynamic Rule Enforcement - 
Users can easily customize the audit by toggling specific rules (like H1 Count, Placeholder Text, or Image Alt Text checks) on or off. This feature demonstrates the extensibility and scalability of our application architecture.

2. Instant Visual Feedback - 
Forget vague error messages. Our audit report provides immediate, highlighted JSON feedback, showing the exact component and content field where the issue was discovered. This dramatically enhances the user experience and provides immediate, actionable insight.

3. Decoupled Architecture - 
The entire application runs on separate, dedicated services. This showcases a robust, real-world deployment strategy and allows both the frontend and backend to be scaled independently.

Technology & Deployment: 
Our project utilizes a high-performance stack for speed and reliability:

1. Frontend (UI): Technology used - Vue.js 3 (Composition API)	& Hosted on Vercel

2. Backend (API): Technology used - Go (gin framework) & Hosted on Render

3. Content Source:	Storyblok (Headless CMS)
